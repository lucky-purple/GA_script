# GA_script

Hi everyone! I created a Google Analytics data extractor that goes forward than the traditional plugins you can find on Google Spreadsheets. I use R and Excel in order to be able to run the entire thing with all its properties.

I got a combination of 3 R files plus 2 Excel/csv files. Basically:
  1) GA.R
  2) URL.Breaker.R
  3) URL.Deduplicator.R
  4) Credential.csv
  5) Extraction.csv
  
 The file to run is the GA.R. The other 2 R files are complementary to it and the 2 csv files are for the setup.
 
 Good luck and let me know how it works. Improvements are welcomed!
